/// Derives the app's formatting from the text *as Markdown* rather than
/// from stored rich-text attributes. The block grammar finds headings and code
/// blocks; the inline grammar finds emphasis and code spans within each
/// paragraph's content. The Markdown source stays the single source of truth
/// for how the document looks.
///
/// tree-sitter-markdown is a "split" grammar: the block parser leaves inline
/// content unparsed in `inline` nodes, which we re-parse with the inline parser.
///
/// The highlighter is the text storage's `NSTextStorageDelegate`. On each user
/// edit `didProcessEditing` hands us the exact edited range and length delta —
/// far better than reconstructing the edit by diffing.
///
/// To keep typing instant on very long documents, the per-keystroke path does
/// the least work that styles the cursor's paragraph correctly: it parses *only
/// that one paragraph's text* in isolation and restyles it. This is bounded by
/// the paragraph's length, not the document's, so it stays fast no matter how
/// big the file is. We still feed tree-sitter a precise `InputEdit` so the full
/// tree stays editable, but the expensive whole-document reparse is *debounced*
/// — it runs once typing pauses, reusing untouched subtrees and restyling the
/// paragraphs the parse says changed, plus any paragraph the local parse styled
/// optimistically. The only visible cost is a brief hitch on a huge document
/// when you stop, and a rare transient mis-style of multi-paragraph constructs
/// (an open code fence) until that deferred parse catches up.
///
/// Everything on the per-keystroke path is kept off the document's length:
///  - We read characters through `storage.mutableString`, a live non-copying
///    proxy, instead of `storage.string`, which snapshots the whole document.
///  - tree-sitter is fed a few-KB chunk at a time from that proxy, so an
///    incremental reparse only reads the regions near the edit.
///  - The row/column `Point`s an `InputEdit` needs come from a line-start index
///    maintained incrementally, so we never rescan the document counting
///    newlines (which, three times per keystroke, dominated large-document cost).
///
/// Incremental tree reuse previously collapsed to an empty `(document)` under
/// release optimization. We keep a safety net: if a reparse degenerates that way
/// over non-empty text, we throw the tree away and parse from scratch, so the
/// styling is always correct even if we occasionally pay for a full parse.
///
/// SwiftTreeSitter parses in UTF-16LE, so every byte offset tree-sitter reports
/// is a UTF-16 *byte* offset — exactly two per `NSString`/`NSRange` UTF-16 code
/// unit, which is why the range conversions here halve byte offsets.
