/// Isolates the per-keystroke costs on a large (≈1.1M character, "Moby
/// Dick"-sized) document so we can see where the latency actually is:
///   - `testIncrementalEditLatency` times one character edit going through the
///     storage delegate — now just the local paragraph parse, since the
///     whole-document reparse is debounced off the keystroke path.
///   - `testDeferredFullParseLatency` times that debounced whole-document
///     reparse, the length-proportional work that now runs only once per pause.
///   - `testBindingConversionLatency` times `AttributedString(storage)`, the
///     whole-document conversion the coordinator pushes through the binding.
